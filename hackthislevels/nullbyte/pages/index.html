<p>Heeey and welcome to my new website! =). This place is sooo boring right now, but once my blog is done i think it will be much better.<br />
Anyway, here is a picture of me<br/><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_f0bvyZMrZ9k/SwsusmHCvHI/AAAAAAAADGg/LcIJf96A9EY/s400/princess.jpg" style="max-width:150px; height: 200px;"/>

Actually that isn't really me. But i want to look like her when i'm older. Only problem is i'm not black... but MJ changed his color, then why wouldn't i be able to do the same?</p>
<p>Ohh... and thanks to my lil-brother for creating this website. Isn't it looking great? I think so atelast! =). He even created a way for me to edit the page without opening the files. 
<a href="admin.php">here it is</a> but you need my password to login... and i'm not telling u what it is :)<br />
Well that's about it. Happy browsing</p>
